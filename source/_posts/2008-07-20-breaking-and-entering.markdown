![解构生活](https://img5.doubanio.com/mpic/s1888039.jpg)

喜欢看电影，特别是那种富有生活气息，哲理韵味的片子，总是喜欢看看别人的，别处的，不一样的生活，然后对照自己的，往往因此入戏，时笑时哭，如痴如呆~~~ 

《[稻草狗](http://movie.douban.com/subject/1293028/)》与《[Breaking and entering](http://movie.douban.com/subject/1783774/)》都是几周前看的电影，却一直回荡在脑海中。或许它们触发我去思考些问题，或许是反思吧。

《[Breaking and entering](http://movie.douban.com/subject/1783774/)》讲的是一个男人，两个女人，两个家庭，五个人的故事。Will和Liv，曾经相爱的两个人，在一起十年，因着Liv娇纵着她的问题女儿，他们日渐疏远了彼此，以至后来Will同Liv说
	
	I don't even know how to be honest.
	Maybe that's why I like metaphors.
	Because what I want to say is there's a circle--yours 
	and Bea's--and I'm not in it. 
	But that's just to justify it, because there's a part of me so dark, 
	that sees that circle as a cage.

Will: I love you.

Liv: Is that an answer?

Will: It's the truth. I feel as if I'm tapping on a window. You're somewhere behind the glass but you can't hear me. Even when you're angry, like now, it's like someone a long long way away is angry with me.

Will：I wish we could unsay and unhurt, back to wherever that is,and start again.I remember you bit me. You were angry with me and you bit me. I dont remember why. You really bit me.And I thought we were very close.

接着Liv咬了他的手，Will说：Yeah, but that's just teeth.

如心绞一般的感触。

不知道为什么，看完这部电影三周了，却一直回想在脑海里。怎样才是爱？激情？责任？性？无语，或许还是片中东欧的妓女对Will说的那句话有道理：

	Animals don't talk, because they don't lie.
